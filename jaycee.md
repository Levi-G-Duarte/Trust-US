1. I did not really do to much on the main server as the other made all of the files and made sure our node was working. I mainly planned out a little bit on paper of what our website should or might look like.
2. I am the Frontend Developer
3. I hope to get the general layout of the main three pages we plan to use.
4. My biggest challenge today was making sure that I did everything correctly.

1. No one in our team could properly agree on the colors we should use for our project.
2. I was using W3schools to look up some things with flex, which currently seems like what our group is likely to use to plan the website. 
3. Me and Christian were using Canva to plan out a general outline for what the pages of our project were going to look like.
