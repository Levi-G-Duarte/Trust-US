1. I did not really do to much on the main server as the other made all of the files and made sure our node was working. I mainly planned out a little bit on paper of what our website should or might look like.
2. I am the Frontend Developer
3. I hope to get the general layout of the main three pages we plan to use.
4. My biggest challenge today was making sure that I did everything correctly.
